### Links to datasets on recipes and foods for recipe_recsys project

Aug 26: Best data sets and related projects found so far are in **bold**

* Kaggle - Using ingredients to categorize cuisine, in JSON (from **[What's Cooking](https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking/data) competition data**)

https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/recipe-ingredients-dataset/home *

Good dataset to start with (from Kaggle playground competition) 

(June 27: **problem** - no recipe name! just id number and list of ingredients - still continue working with it because it is the smallest and cleanest recipe dataset we found so far)

Related projects:

   * Forked on Kaggle (learn algorithms):  Cuisine classifier *

   * Top 10 most used ingredients (improve with word-stemming)
https://www.kaggle.com/manuelatadvice/noname - simple starter code, using original What's Cooking dataset (id, ingredients and *cuisine type, i.e. Indian*)
   * **Cultural Diffusion by recipe**s https://www.kaggle.com/alonalevy/cultural-diffusion-by-recipes (original What's Cooking dataset)

   * Cluster food by cuisine - using Kmeans, read less readable? also has bugs
https://www.kaggle.com/vincentclaes/clustering-food-by-cuisine

   * Word2Vec with ingredients https://www.kaggle.com/ccorbi/word2vec-with-ingredients (comments in data cleaning and exploration were helpful, but unclear how they got from finding similar vectorized *ingredients* to clustering *cuisines*)
   


* Reddit - a collection of food dataset links (also look into flavor profile repo)

https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/8nc1d3/is_there_a_dataset_for_a_list_of_all_foods/

  * Flavor network project https://github.com/lingcheng99/Flavor-Network *
  
  

* **recipe box**: Scrape of ~125,000 recipes (with cooking instructions) from various food websites, 70,000 have associated images
https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/#fn:1 [repo here](https://github.com/rtlee9/recipe-box)


* Scrape of recipes from various websites (Epicurious, BBC, Allrecipes and Cookstr) (- June 27: having trouble opening downloaded zipped files?)

https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/94awca/thousands_of_recipes_from_epicurious_bbc/

   * Seems to be the same crawl here, **140,000 English Recipes** in computer-readable form with photos (same 4 sites, in HTML and JSON): https://archive.org/details/recipes-en-201706 * 

   * related project looking at 3 decades of Epicurious food data (to look at food trends?):

Technical article from NYTimes: "Extracting Structured Data From Recipes Using Conditional Random Fields" *

   * Comments are very interesting also (found their (archived) GitHub code there)

   * https://github.com/nytimes/ingredient-phrase-tagger
NYTimes Cooking has a database of 17000+ recipes at the time of writing (April 2015) -- no ingredient name or list, just index and instructions

   * Also someone commented they made a related API:

  > "The spoonacular Nutrition, Recipe, and Food API allows you to access over 365,000 recipes and 86,000 food products. Our food ontology and semantic recipe search engine makes it possible to search for recipes using natural language queries"

Kaggle dataset: 568454 fine food reviews from Amazon, from 1999 to 2012 (SQLite)
https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews

(quite a few sentiment analysis projects, but someone did build a prediction system out of it - see top kernel) also fine foods here seem like fancy snacks and condiments with brands, not foods for recipes 


Reddit thread requesting labelled images of food:
